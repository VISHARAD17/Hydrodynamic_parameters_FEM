## Added Mass and Damping Coefficient of a typical ship (Barge) section in Heave, Sway and Roll motion
- Implementation of **Finite element method** to calculate Added Mass and Damping Coefficient using `MATLAB` using radiation and diffraction pheomena
- Detailed report about the Implentation and Theory can be found [here](https://github.com/VISHARAD17/Hydrodynamic_parameters_FEM/blob/main/FEM_report.pdf) and codes for the same [here](https://github.com/VISHARAD17/Hydrodynamic_parameters_FEM/tree/main/code)
